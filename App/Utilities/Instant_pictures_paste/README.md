# Instant Picture Paste
Invoked with Ctrl + Windows + I

Will look for any image in the clipboard and convert it into a file named "Image.png"
 - Note that the script will leave an extra copy of said file inside its directory.

Intended to be used with any screenshot tool to quickly save the image by pasting it into the target directory
without having to navigate to the folder via GUI.
