# Python-Utilities
A python repository to store and manage python utilities for Windows QoL, think of it as PowerToys.

The project needs the global_hotkeys, pillow and pywin32 modules to be installed in order to be able to run.

Currently, the utilities are to be run by adding a shortcut to App\Utilities\UtilityRun.py in windows autostart.
