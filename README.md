# Python-Utilities
A python repository to store and manage python utilities for Windows QoL, think of it as powertoys.

I will put the scripts I make here

Currently they are to be run by adding a shortcut to App\Utilities\UtilityRun.py in windows autostart

 - C:\Users\\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

 - or Run - "shell:startup" (windows + R)
